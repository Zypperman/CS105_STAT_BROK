1. plot meaningful category combinations (aka TSI and Aerosol can alr)
2. create plots for all samples where meaningul trends are seen
3. create plots for all samples where meaningul trends are seen BUT SPLIT BY CATEGORY
4. generate correlation coefficient values for each significant correlation
    any corr coefficient > 0.6 is worth exploring and considered strong correlation, else its weak
    consider for linear parts of  non-linear trends
    add coef in the title for each significant plot
    justify why this might be so
5. find similar plots and group them

Variables mapped:
CO2
CH4
Temp
MEI
CFC-11
CFC-12
continuous_months (months + year * 12)

- separate data by grouping and see if any trend exists as well.

Things to note:
-for each graph, put corr coe in the title
